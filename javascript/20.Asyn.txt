JS is a syncronous language 
it works on single threads

blocking code VS non-blocking code Aka sysncronous vs asyncronous

the usecase makes each one effective over other

syncronous says you have to wait until the other process finishes
asyncronous says that you can continue  to do another performable task which another is being processed
